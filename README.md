# CMPE 491-492

[CMPE 492](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/courses/cmpe492) is a compulsory *project* course for Boğaziçi Computer Engineering ([Boun CMPE](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr)) students. With [CMPE 491](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/courses/cmpe492) elective course, it can be turned into two semesters long project where students can dive into their chosen project quite in depth. Usually they are taken by senior students and every semester we have great live poster sessions where everyone is welcomed.

I have taken the duo in 2019-2020 academic season under the supervision of [Assistant Professor İnci Baytaş](https://cmpe.boun.edu.tr/people/inci.baytas). We have worked on several small research projects in the *Adversarial Machine Learning* domain. Here, you can find some of the course deliverables including two posters prepared for the end of the semesters. Based on these research-oriented projects, we have published one paper on *facilitating adversarial robustness with orthogonalization* in [SIU 2020](http://siu2020.medipol.edu.tr) and submitted another on *randomizing PGD attack pixel-wise* to [ECCV 2020](https://eccv2020.eu).

Feel free to contact me about this project, Adversarial Machine Learning or about CMPE and Boğaziçi University.
